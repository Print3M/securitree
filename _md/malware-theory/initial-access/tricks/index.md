# Malware Delivery Tricks

## RTLO

Right-To-Left Override (RTLO) is a non-printing Unicode character (`U+202e`) used to support languages read in the right-to-left manner, like Hebrew and Arabic. This character flips all subsequent text to be right-to-left when displayed. Starting from the RTLO to the end the text is flipped. This character is also supported in file names on Windows.

The file name `example[U+202e]xcod.exe` will be displayed as `exampleexe.docx`. Although the file still has an `exe` extension, the user sees a `docx` fake-extension. This provides many opportunities to deceive the victim.

Windows Defender detects RTLOs in file names if they add a fake file extension. Replacing `txt.exe` with `exe.txt` can be detected because `.txt` is an existing extension. So you can use for the fake extension an identical-looking Cyrillic alphabet letter to confuse the AV: "Ñ…" [U+0445] instead of ASCII "x".

## Spaces before file extension

The file name can contain a ton of spaces before the extension. In some views (such as Windows file explorer), such a name will be too long and the spaces will be cut out, hiding the true file extension. Example: `file.txt <spaces>.exe`.

You may want to add something else before the extension so that spaces are not at the very end of the file name. Just to confuse the EDR rules.

## Double file extension

A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed. For example `file.txt.exe` may render in some views (e.g. Windows file explorer, cloud storage) as just `file.txt`.
