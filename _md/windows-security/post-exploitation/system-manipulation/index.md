# System manipulation

If we already have SYSTEM privileges on a machine, we often want to make some changes so that we can get back to that machine more easily.

## Local users and groups and management

```powershell
# Create user
net user $username $password /add

# Delete user
net user $username /delete

# Enable user
net user $username /active:yes

# Disable user
net user administrator /active:no

# Change user's password
net user $username $password

# Add user to a local group
net localgroup $group $username /add

# Delete user from a local group
net localgroup $group $username /delete
```
