# Windows Lateral Movement

At SecuriTree, we define Lateral Movement as a situation where an attacker already has valid credentials (e.g. password, NT hash or Kerberos TGT) and his job is to use them to gain access to new resources on the network.

This site does not focus on obtaining credentials (privilege escalation).
