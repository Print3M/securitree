# Exploits

## Exploit-DB

[Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) (EDB) is probably the largest database of publicly available exploits on the Internet. It has an advanced search engine, all exploits are checked before being added to the database, and many are verified for quality.

It has also CLI on Kali Linux:

```bash
searchsploit --update               # Update local DB
searchsploit $phrase1 $phrase2      # Search in Exploit-DB
searchsploit -m $exploit_path       # Copy exploit to cwd
searchsploit -m $exploit_id         # Copy exploit to cwd
usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/       # Default path of Exploit-DB
```

## Packet Storm

[Packet Storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com) is a security website that provides up-to-date information on news, exploits, and tools (published tools by security vendors) for educational and testing purposes.

## Metasploit

Metasploit is a free exploit framework owned by _Rapi7_:

> **NOTE**: Metsploit database is not the same as Exploit-DB!

```bash
msfdb init                                  # Init Metasploit DB
msfconsole                                  # Run metasploit
> search <regex>                            # Search for exploit
> use <exploit-path>                        # Use exploit
> options                                   # Lists options
> set <OPTION> <VALUE>                      # Set option
> run                                       # Run exploit
> back                                      # Exit exploit view

# To get reverse shell (run listener): exploit/multi/handler
> CTRL + z                                  # Background current session
> sessions                                  # List all sessions
> sessions <num>                            # Restore session
```

## Nmap NSE scripts

NSE scripts for Nmap also include exploits:

```bash
# Find NSE exploits
grep Exploits /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse

# Display information about NSE exploit
nmap --script-help=$nse_name

```

## Others

It's always a good idea to look for exploits on **GitHub** and using **Google dorks**. You can find different things in Chinese forums than in publicly available exploit databases.

> **WARNING**: Beware of executing exploits downloaded from random places on the Internet! They may contain malware.
