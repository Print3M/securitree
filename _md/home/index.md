# SecuriTree

SecuriTree is a knowledge base of offensive IT security topics (pentesting and red-teaming) structured in the form of trees. Thanks to this form of article presentation, you can immediately see what options you have to achieve your goal.

SecuriTree's goal is to provide structured knowledge of offensive IT security topics, which are often treated selectively and non-technically on the Internet without a deeper understanding. An important aspect of this project is the consideration of possible alternatives to achieve the goal, e.g. domain lateral movement or Active Directory privilege escalation. A common problem especially for beginners is the lack of an overview of all possibilities and using only simple techniques (often without understanding them) to perform a given attack. This was also my problem.

The knowledge base of IT security in the form of a tree was inspired by the so-called _attack tree methodology_. This interesting methodology focuses on listing all possible paths to achieve a given goal (I encourage you to google it).

Happy hacking :)
