# Credentials dump

By dumping the LSASS memory or SAM database, we can get credentials of other local and domain users. The obtained credentials can be used for [lateral movement](/windows-lateral-movement) or [password spraying](password-spraying) attack.

> **WARNING**: Mimikatz is currently very well detected by antiviruses.
