# Credential Manager (CredMan)
Users may choose to save passwords in Windows using an application or through the Credential Manager Control Panel applet. These credentials are stored on disk and protected using the Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI), which encrypts them with a key derived from the userâ€™s password. Any program running as that user will be able to access credentials in this store.
